“He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.”
	 - Viktor E. Frankl

we take a friendly view of our own private affairs, and partiality always obscures our judgment. I fancy that many men would have arrived at wisdom had they not 
believed themselves to have arrived there already, had they not purposely deceived themselves as to some parts of their character, and passed by others with their eyes shut:
for you have no grounds for supposing that other people's flattery is more ruinous to us than our own.
	 - Seneca

In all cases one should be careful in one's choice of men, and see whether they be worthy of our bestowing a part of our life upon them, 
or whether we shall waste our own time and theirs also:
	 - Seneca

the best amount of property to have is that which is enough to keep us from poverty, and which yet is not far removed from it.
	 - Seneca

it is much better to devote yourself to a few writers than to skim through many.
	 - Seneca

No condition can be so wretched that an impartial mind can find no compensations in it.
	 - Seneca

Call good sense to your aid against difficulties: it is possible to soften what is harsh, to widen what is too narrow, 
and to make heavy burdens press less severely upon one who bears them skillfully.
	 - Seneca

It is too late to school the mind to endurance of peril after peril has done.
	 - Seneca

Know then that every station of life is transitory, and that what has ever happened to anybody may happen to you also.
	 - Seneca

unless you expect that whatever can happen will happen to you, you give adversity power against you,
	 - Seneca

for as a rule sadness arises from one of these two things, either from want of success or from being ashamed of having succeeded.
	 - Seneca

Zeno, the chief of our school, when he heard the news of a shipwreck, in which all his property had been lost, remarked, 
"Fortune bids me follow philosophy in lighter marching order."
	 - Seneca

it better becomes a man to scoff at life than to lament over it.
	 - Seneca

what, too, can a good man hope to obtain when he sees the best of men meeting with the worst fates. Well, but see how each of them endured his fate, and if they endured it
bravely, long in your heart for courage as great as theirs;
	 - Seneca

It also proves a fertile source of troubles if you take pains to conceal your feelings and never show yourself to any one undisguised, but, as many men do, 
live an artificial life, in order to impose upon others: for the constant watching of himself becomes a torment to a man, and he dreads being caught doing something at 
variance with his usual habits, and, indeed, we never can be at our ease if we imagine that everyone who looks at us is weighing our real value:
	 - Seneca

life is neither happy nor safe when one always has to wear a mask. But what pleasure there is in that honest straight-forwardness which is its own ornament, 
and which conceals no part of its character?
	 - Seneca

it is enough to possess only as many books as you can read.
	 - Seneca

time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.
	 - Seneca

after you have run over many thoughts, select one to be thoroughly digested that day.
	 - Seneca

It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor.
	 - Seneca

Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.
	 - Seneca

Philosophy calls for plain living, but not for penance;
	 - Seneca

No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it.
	 - Seneca

Democritus says: “One man means as much to me as a multitude, and a multitude only as much as one man.”
	 - Seneca

a man is sheltered just as well by a thatch as by a roof of gold.
	 - Seneca

What Chance has made yours is not really yours.
	 - Seneca

The good that could be given, can be removed.
	 - Seneca

Our span of life is divided into parts; it consists of large circles enclosing smaller. One circle embraces and bounds the rest;
	 - Seneca

we suffer more often in imagination than in reality.
	 - Seneca

How often has the unexpected happened! How often has the expected never come to pass!
	 - Seneca
what does it avail to run out to meet your suffering? You will suffer soon enough, when it arrives; so look forward meanwhile to better things. 
What shall you gain by doing this?
	 - Seneca

“Perhaps the worst will not happen.” You yourself must say, “Well, what if it does happen? Let us see who wins!
	 - Seneca

the outcome of a mighty anger is madness, and hence anger should be avoided, not merely that we may escape excess, but that we may have a healthy mind.
	 - Seneca

Just as it matters little whether you lay a sick man on a wooden or on a golden bed, for whithersoever he be moved he will carry his malady with him; 
so one need not care whether the diseased mind is bestowed upon riches or upon poverty. His malady goes with the man.
	 - Seneca

men do not know what they wish, except at the actual moment of wishing;
	 - Seneca

So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good.
I am better off than he is,—for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows; I neither know nor think that I know.
	 - Socrates

If you think that by killing men you can prevent some one from censuring your evil lives, you are mistaken;
	 - Socrates

But you are not Hercules and you are not able to purge away the wickedness of others; nor yet are you Theseus, able to pure away the evil things of Attica. 
Clear away your own. From yourself, from your thoughts cast away, instead of Procrustes and Sciron, sadness, fear, desire, envy, malevolence, avarice,
effeminacy, intemperance.
	 - Epictetus

for you seek tranquillity there where it is not, and you neglect to seek it where it is.
	 - Epictetus

For this is the greatest proof of unhappiness and misery: “I wish for something, and it does not happen.”
	 - Epictetus

do not expect, when you are laboring at one thing, to make progress in another.
	 - Epictetus

“as a stone, if you cast it upward, will be brought down to the earth by its own nature, so the man whose mind is naturally good, the more you repel him,
the more he turns toward that to which he is naturally inclined.”
	 - Epictetus

“But I can throw into prison any man whom I please.” So you can do with a stone. “But I can beat with sticks whom I please.” 
So you may an ass. This is not a governing of men. Govern us as rational animals: show us what is profitable to us, and we will follow it: 
show us what is unprofitable, and we will turn away from it. Make us imitators of yourself, as Socrates made men imitators of himself.
	 - Epictetus

“Do this: do not do this: if you do not obey, I will throw you into prison.” This is not governing men like rational animals.
	 - Epictetus

it is in your power to be happy while you are suffering what you suffer;
	 - Epictetus

For to every man the cause of his acting is opinion.
	 - Epictetus

“If I attend to such matters, I shall have no land, as you have none; I shall have no silver cups as you have none, nor fine beasts as you have none.” 
In answer to this it is perhaps sufficient to say: I have no need of such things:
	 - Epictetus

I am not anxious what Caesar will think of me: for this reason, I flatter no man.
	 - Epictetus

do not desire many things and you will have what you want.
	 - Epictetus

Let sleep not come upon thy languid eyes Before each daily action thou hast scann’d; What’s done amiss, what done, what left undone; 
From first to last examine all, and then Blame what is wrong in what is right rejoice.
	 - Epictetus

Is the world going to be turned upside down when you are dead?
	 - Epictetus

you must know that if you allow your desire and aversion to turn to things which are not within the power of the will, 
you will neither have your desire capable of attaining your object, nor your aversion free from the power of avoiding that which you would avoid.
	 - Epictetus

When a man has such things to think on, and sees the sun, the moon and stars, and enjoys earth and sea, he is not solitary nor even helpless.
	 - Epictetus

In every act consider what precedes and what follows, and then proceed to the act.
	 - Epictetus

remember that nothing else is the cause of perturbation or loss of tranquillity except our own opinion,
	 - Epictetus

The carpenter does not come and say, “Hear me talk about the carpenter’s art”; but having undertaken to build a house, he makes it, and proves that he knows the art.
	 - Epictetus

First say to yourself, who you wish to be: then do accordingly
	 - Epictetus

For who is good if he knows not who he is?
	 - Epictetus

To desire, then, things which are impossible is to have a slavish character and is foolish:
	 - Epictetus

we ought not to desire in every way what is not our own.
	 - Epictetus

a good man does nothing for the sake of appearance, but for the sake of doing right.
	 - Epictetus
For it is not reasonable to be means-spirited nor to lament yourself, nor to depend on another, nor even to blame God or man.
	 - Epictetus

what is not my own; possessions are not my own, nor kinsmen, domestics, friends, nor reputation, nor places familiar, nor mode of life; all these belong to others.” 
What then is your own? “The use of appearances. This be showed to me, that I possess it free from hindrance, and from compulsion, no person can put an obstacle in my way,
no person can force me to use appearances otherwise than I wish.” Who then has any power over me? Philip or Alexander, or Perdiccas or the Great King?
How have they this power? For if a man is going to be overpowered by a man, he must long before be overpowered by things. 
If, then, pleasure is not able to subdue a man, nor pain, nor fame, nor wealth, but he is able, when he chooses, to spit out all his poor body in a man’s face and 
depart from life, whose slave can he still be?
	 - Epictetus

If it is a good thing, it is the cause of no evil: if it is bad, I have nothing to do with it. I am formed by nature for my own good: I am not formed for my own evil.
	 - Epictetus
seek not the good in things external; seek it in yourselves: if you do not, you will not find it.’
	 - Epictetus

Only do not make a proud display of it, nor boast of it; but show it by your acts; 
and if no man perceives it, be satisfied that you are yourself in a healthy state and happy.
	 - Epictetus

He is free who lives as he wishes to live; who is neither subject to compulsion nor to hindrance, nor to force; whose movements to action are not impeded, 
whose desires attain their purpose, and who does not fall into that which he would avoid.
	 - Epictetus

For no man fears Caesar himself, but he fears death, banishment, deprivation of his property, prison, and disgrace. Nor does any man love Caesar, unless Caesar is a
person of great merit, but he loves wealth, the office of tribune, praetor or consul. When we love, and hate, and fear these things, it must be that those who have 
the power over them must be our masters. Therefore we adore them even as gods; for we think that what possesses the power of conferring the greatest advantage on us 
is divine. Then we wrongly assume that a certain person has the power of conferring the greatest advantages; therefore he is something divine.
	 - Epictetus

“What if they are necessary to me?” Do not attach yourself to them and they will not be necessary: do not say to yourself that they are necessary, 
and then they are not necessary.
	 - Epictetus

But I can point out to you a free man, that you may no longer seek an example. Diogenes was free.
	 - Epictetus

that there is no profit from the things which are valued and eagerly sought to those who have obtained them; and to those who have not yet obtained them there is an 
imagination that when these things are come, all that is good will come with them; then, when they are come, the feverish feeling is the same, the tossing to and fro is 
the same, the satiety, the desire of things which are not present; for freedom is acquired not by the full possession of the things which are desired, 
but by removing the desire.
	 - Epictetus

Keep this thought in readiness, when you lose anything external, what you acquire in place of it; and if it be worth more, never say, “I have had a loss”;
	 - Epictetus

that what you shall prize which is beyond your will, so far you have destroyed your will.
	 - Epictetus

But do you, until you know the opinion from which a man does each thing, neither praise nor blame the act.
	 - Epictetus

for from within comes ruin and from within comes help.
	 - Epictetus

The difficulties of all men are about external things, their helplessness is about externals. 
“What shall I do, how will it be, how will it turn out, will this happen, will that?” 
All these are the words of those who are turning themselves to things which are not within the power of the will.
	 - Epictetus

why do you not straightway, after considering wherein your good is and your evil, say, “Both of them are in my power?
Neither can any man deprive me of the good, nor involve me in the bad against my will.
	 - Epictetus

If nature had entrusted to you a horse, would you have overlooked and neglected him? And now think that you have been intrusted with your own body as with a horse;
	 - Epictetus

If it is good to use attention to-morrow, how much better is it to do so to-day? if to-morrow it is in your interest to attend, much more is it to-day,
	 - Epictetus

“The man who says that he has no illusions has at least that one.”
	 - Jospeh Conrad

The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him,
	 - Dostoyevsky

a man is rarely ready to admit another’s suffering
	 - Dostoyevsky

“If I fail I don’t lose heart, if I succeed I persevere.”
	 - Dostoyevsky

to forgive and forget injuries is the height of virtue.
	 - Dostoyevsky

“There are people who find satisfaction in their own touchy feelings, especially when they have just taken the deepest offence; 
at such moments they feel that they would rather be offended than not. These easily-ignited natures, if they are wise, are always full of remorse afterwards,
when they reflect that they have been ten times as angry as they need have been.
	 - Dostoyevsky

We must never forget that human motives are generally far more complicated than we are apt to suppose, 
and that we can very rarely accurately describe the motives of another.
	 - Dostoyevsky

In short, one may say anything about the history of the world — anything that might enter the most disordered imagination.
The only thing one can’t say is that it’s rational. The very word sticks in one’s throat.
	 - Dostoyevsky

Man likes to make roads and to create, that is a fact beyond dispute. But why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos also?
	 - Dostoyevsky

He loves the process of attaining, but does not quite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd. In fact, man is a comical creature;
	 - Dostoyevsky

Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering,
	 - Dostoyevsky

man is fond of reckoning up his troubles, but does not count his joys.
	 - Dostoyevsky

in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,
which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards.
	 - Dostoyevsky

The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he will be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler the trap he must be caught in.
	 - Dostoyevsky
